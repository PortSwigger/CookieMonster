<p>This extension simplifies the filtering of cookies in requests.</p>

<p>The plugin loads cookies from Open-Cookie-Database which is a collection of categorised cookies. By default, this extension will filter any cookies from the Open-Cookie-Database that are marked as non-functional:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Preferences</li>
	<li>Analytics</li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also select any text in the request editor and manually send it to CookieMonster to filter out for any custom cookie values.</p>

<p>Any cookie configurations are saved on a per-project basis.</p>

<p>Wildcard: The plugin uses the behavior described in the Open-Cookie-Database for dynamic cookies. For example, if a wildcard filter for "_ga" is enabled, all cookies starting with this value will be filtered ie." _gac_1234".</p>
